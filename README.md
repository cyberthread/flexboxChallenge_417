# Flexbox Challenge: New Yorker Remake
This challenge centers on creating layouts using flexbox. Remember that, when possible, you put layout rules on the parent item (the only thing that might go on a child item is something like width in this exercise). For the purposes of this exercise we will focus on implementing one breakpoint (i.e. default mobile design with one media query). No HTML needs to be modified.

*This exercise can be completed with a partner*

In this exercise you will:
- Practice breaking layouts down into smaller component pieces that each need their own layouts.
- Nest flexbox layouts into other flexbox layouts.
- Implement a layout that changes depending on viewport width.

## Tasks
### Preview
- First take a look at an [example article on the New Yorker magazine website](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/how-beeple-crashed-the-art-world). Change the browser window size to see how the header of the article changes across screen sizes (note we are focused on the article and not the header of the page which contains the site identifier and navigation). 
- Next take a look at the prototypes in the screenshots folder to better understand the default (narrow) design and the first breakpoint design (medium or the first media query).

### Breakdown into modules
This layout is complex it has 3 different modules that need to be implemented using flexbox. I recommend working from the outside in (i.e. top to bottom in the list that follows). Read through all three before getting started.
- The general one column design that shifts to a two equal column design. The default/mobile layout is already implemented.
- The "description" or text-based content also has a general layout. It is restricted in width (already implemented) but should be centered vertically and horizontally.
- The social media icons should be in an equally spaced horizontal row on all screen sizes.

### Show your work
- On Blackboard submit your styles.css file and screenshots demonstrating that you have valid code.
- In class show your instructor or TA your completed work in a browser and in Visual Studio code. Also be prepared to show that your code is valid.
